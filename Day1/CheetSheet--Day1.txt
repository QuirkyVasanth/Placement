*****Expansion*****
jdk--Java Development Kit
jre--Java Runtime Environment
jvm--Java Virtual Machine
jit--Just in Time Compiler


****Operating System(OS)****
windows
Mac OS 
Ubuntu
Unix 
Linux 
kali Linux


****Languages****
C--Mostly C language is used to communicate directly with hardwares.Ex-Embedded Systems
C++--Every Microsoft windows OS contains C++ by default,to communicate with hardwares by UserInterface
     Ex--Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 10
java--Used for creating desktop application and web applications too.



      
****Description****

 **bytecode****     --made of numbers+symbols+alphabets. Ex--1f2$%^
 **binarycode**     --made of only 0s and 1s. Ex--01001


JIT  --Located inside JVM,make compilation faster when it found lines are repeated.
Jre  --It provides Environment to run the code,and it also contains libraries like java.util,java.lang etc
JVM  --converts byte to binary code.
Compiler--Converts source code to byte code.
Debugger--Identify the Errors and Rectify it.


What is JDK?
Expansion of JDK is Java Development Kit, which consists of JRE and JVM.
Especially JDK contains Compiler and Debugger.


What is JRE?
Expansion of JRE is Java Runtime Environment.JRE consists of JVM.
It provides the environment to run code.
JRE contains Libraries like Java.util, Java.lang etc


What is JVM?
Expansion of JVM is Java Virtual Machine.
Which converts byte code to binary code.
JVM Contains,
            Class loader        --Loads the required  class for running the program.
            ByteCode verifier   --verifies the Bytecode is valid or not.
            Method Areas        --consists of heap,stack,pc registers. which is used to store  
                                  variables,objects etc. 
            GarbageCollector    --Which cleans or free up memory by removing the unused object.
